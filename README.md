# üß† MNIST Digit Classification using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It uses **PyTorch** for training and **Typer** for command-line interaction. The model tracks performance metrics and provides visualizations for loss, accuracy, and misclassifications.

---

## üì¶ Dataset: MNIST

The MNIST dataset consists of **70,000 grayscale images** (28x28 pixels) of handwritten digits (0‚Äì9).

- **Training Set**: 60,000 images  
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images  
- **Classes**: 10 (digits 0 to 9)

The dataset is automatically downloaded using `torchvision.datasets.MNIST`.

## üß† Model Architecture

### Convolutional Layers
- 3 Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
- Each followed by **MaxPooling** to reduce spatial dimensions

### Fully Connected Layers
- 3 Dense layers for high-level feature learning and classification
